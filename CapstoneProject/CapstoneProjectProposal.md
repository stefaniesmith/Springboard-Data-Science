#Capstone Project Proposal

## Introduction

Across the country, many public school teachers use their own money to buy supplies for their classrooms, including basic essentials like notebooks and pencils. If schools and teachers cannot afford these supplies, students may miss out on learning opportunities. DonorsChoose.org was established to help teachers get the resources they need for classroom projects. Through the DonorsChoose.org website, teachers can request materials for their classrooms. Donors can browse through requests, and select a project they would like to support financially.

The goal of this capstone project is to provide guidance to teachers who are using DonorsChoose.org to fund their classroom projects.  This will include suggestions on how to select a school project that has a greater chance of receiving funding. Information will be provided on how to structure essay requests, and the preferred tone of the requests to improve the chance of getting donations.

## Data

Data for this capstone project will be obtained from the DonorsChoose.org open datasets:

<https://data.donorschoose.org/open-data/overview/>

This includes information on donations, school projects, resources requested, school information, and written essays describing the projects.

## Approach

Data analysis will be conducted using R. The datasets from DonorsChoose.org will be cleaned and then combined into a single dataset.

Factors that may affect a project's chances of getting funding (including subject area, resources requested, school location, grade level, poverty level, etc.) will be analyzed. Essay requests will be examined using text sentiment analysis and readability analysis. A model will be developed to predict the likelihood of funding based on these factors. 

## Deliverables

Deliverables for this capstone project will be made available through GitHub, including:

*	R code
*	Paper outlining the problem, approach and results from the data analysis
*	Slide deck summarizing the results
