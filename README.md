## Capstone Project: Predicting Classroom Project Funding with R ##

Across the country, many public school teachers use their own money to buy supplies for their classrooms, including basic essentials like notebooks and pencils. DonorsChoose.org was established to help teachers get the resources they need for classroom projects. Through the website, teachers can request materials for their classrooms. Donors can browse through requests, and select a project they would like to support financially.

The goal of this capstone project was to understand what types of classroom projects receive full funding by analyzing data available from DonorsChoose.org. A classification tree was built using R to predict whether a project would receive full funding based on factors within a teacher's control. Full details of the analysis, and recommendations for teachers to improve their chances of success can be found in the capstone project report and slide presentation.
